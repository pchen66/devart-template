We think what lies behind the painting is similar to imagination without limitations. Users can be fascinated with a painting, but they can also be immersed in the world behind it as long as they want to engage with the art piece. We have deisgned the smooth transisiton from 2D to 3D just like 'falling' into the painting. While traveling in the Mondrian city, he/she perceives a totally different angle as if being in the art itself. What interests us the most is the shared design space with other participants around the world. Collaborative design gives a new meaning (dimension) to Mondrian.

In addition to Mondrian city, we would like to design the gallery as well. Maybe each furniture in the room represent certain view or object in the city. We'll continue iterate on this idea more.
