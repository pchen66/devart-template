Initially we thought we have time to complete 3D part behind three paintings, but we decided to focus on creating one intersting experience instead three insipid visualizations. Mondrian is our top choice because most of his works were 2D and static, yet we want to show the possibility that a painting within a limited canvas could also be unlimited in a different perspective.

Therefore, we start to refine our idea on digital experience and multi-user interactions. The experience should be shared among audiences who participate in it and a continuous process that never ends. We also iterated on interactions such as a user can change the shape of 'cube', color, or he/she can declare the room as personal space with customized decorations. The next step for us is to define the scope and limit the choices.

On the technology side, we use Node.js to host a shared space and websocket to update/broadcast new changes by each user. PointerLock API is also used to simulate the first-person-shooter style in the 3D world.
