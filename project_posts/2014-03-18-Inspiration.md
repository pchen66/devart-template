We always stand in front of an art piece, think about its meaning, and wonder why the artist did that. However, with technology online today we can do more. Imagine we can meet monalisa in person or see the painter from her viewpoint. As for Mondrian, we can transform the 2D painting into a 3D world and let user browse and actually engage in the painting.
