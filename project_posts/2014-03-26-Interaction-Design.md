Every user represents a primary color (white, yellow, red, or blue). While wondering walking on the street, he/she can paint the city collaboratively and simultaneously with other users. All users can contribute and be credited as the creator of this never ending art piece.

By digging into the shared expereince more, we found an interesting point of the combination of art and code in this project: we start from a famous art painting and generate a 3D world behind it by coding. What if we can be extracted aesthetic information from the 3D world and form another kind of art? We thought of the idea of using Augmented Reality to accomplish. Detail will be explained in tomorrow's post.
