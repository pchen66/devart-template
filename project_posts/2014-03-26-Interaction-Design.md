Every user represents a primary color (white, yellow, red, or blue). While wondering walking on the street, he/she can paint the city collaboratively and simultaneously with other users. All users can contribute and be credited as the creator of this never ending art piece.

By digging into the shared expereince more, we found an interesting point of the combination of art and code in this project: we start from a famous art painting and generate a 3D world behind it by coding. What if we can be extracted aesthetic information from the 3D world and form another kind of art? We thought of the idea of using Augmented Reality to accomplish.

We adjusted the focus of the project a little. The focus right now is just on the Mondrian paintings so we can create those with quality instead of doing multiple painting with less quality. Indeed, it is the same old story of finding balance between quantity and quality. In choosing to focus just on Mondrian paintings some interesting ideas popped up that we are implementing. 

As you know by now, the 2d painting is hanging on the wall and the interactor has the opportunity to click no the painting to enter another dimension, ‘the world behind the painting’. In this world the interactor can suddenly move around in a 3d environment based on the 2d painting. Furthermore, interactors have the possibility to start painting themselves. Mondriaan always used the three primary colors blue, yellow and red. Thus, interactors will randomly be assigned one of these colors and be able to paint the buildings. Besides the three primary colors there is also a white-variant seeing that a big part of the painting is usually also white. 

Multiple interactors can be present in the 3d Mondrian environment. Sometimes you will even see another interactor moving and painting the world, right now they are represented as simple cubes. Using your mobile phone you will be able to do all these interactions. As everybody paints, not only the 3d environment changes but also the 2d painting. If an interactor decides to leave the 3d world of Mondrian, chances are that he or she will see differences on the 2d paintings depending on what has been changed in the 3d world. Consequently, interactors become painters themselves, together. 

As such interactors explore a painting in different ways than a traditional viewing of the 2d painting, and they not only explore but collaboratively create. This can lead to different experiences of art, even traditional well known art such as the Mondrian painting. On top of that, one can wonder what happens to the notion of a gallery when people can dynamically change what is in front of them. We intend to take this even a step further by making use of Picasa and augmented reality. 

Every 15 minutes a screenshot will be taken of the 2d version of a Mondrian painting. This screenshot will be placed in a Picasa gallery. Notice how in Picasa also the term gallery is used and there is now a play with this concept on several levels. Each screenshot will hold the names of the people who participated in its creation during those 15 minutes. These people are now also the painters, the artists. Their ‘paintings’ are now also part of the art, part of the gallery and a possible exhibition. Although people can use this technology from the comfort of their own home, we also envision this to be successful as an art installation where people go to a physical location such as a museum and this entire process of creating new Mondrian painting in a 3d world and these creations being displayed will be visible to visitors/interactors. 

To take it even further we want to show the screenshots in the Picasa album on the walls of that physical location using Augmented Reality. Seeing interactors are already using their mobile phones to move around in the 3d Mondrian world, it is a small step to use your mobile phone to see your own creation hanging on the wall at the physical location such as a museum (but hypothetically it can be any place). As such the notion of the gallery gets extended even further, from a traditional 2d art piece such as the Mondrian paintings, interactors move into a 3d world to start painting, which has an effect in both the 3d and 3d version of the painting, which leads to the creation of a new collaborative art piece, which gets displayed at the physical location in augmented reality. 

In short, one can say that interactors explore several processes involved in the creation of art and thus experience much more than when looking at a 2d painting in a traditional museum. They explore different dimensions, perspectives and modes of participation. Just imagine the story a person will tell once he or she has engaged in such an activity. It won’t be a story about how a museum was visited and he or she saw such a nice painting, it will be how they interacted with the painting, re-created it together, they truly explored possible directions of creation with regards to painting.
